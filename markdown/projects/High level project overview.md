# High-level Project Overview
## Describing and Showcasing Current Programming Projects

### Introduction
31-01-2023: 69 days left before the exam period starts. 
The aim is to have several programming projects as exam candidates and a well-documented TSPA2 that can function without me for a long time after leaving DTU Sustain. Having production-ready programming projects is an advantage when searching for a job.

The main reasons for creating these projects are:
1. To have a reference code reference in my CV
2. To have a project for the exam period

### Projects
- Victor's Web Framework: A streamlined solution for building web applications
- Webshop: victors bog vezit.net
- TSPA2: A scripting app that automates tasks when a new PC is PXE installed
- Artek
- Lyngby Frisbee Klub, membership and subscription portal (lfk.vezit.net)
- Inform (out-of-service): A Python script that checks if a PC is out of service
- Equip-Online: An application that tracks all computers and their owners, notifying by email if a PC is out of warranty.
