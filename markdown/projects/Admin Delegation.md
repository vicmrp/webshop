# Admin Delegation

A web-based tool that enables the IT department to delegate administrative rights on PCs to specific users. The application is user-friendly and easy to use. Upon logging in, the IT department can search for either a user or a PC and access the following features:

## Searching for a user 
- Displays a list of PCs where the user has been granted administrative rights through this system, and the duration of those rights.

## Searching for a PC
- Allows for direct access to the PC and presents input fields where the IT department can specify the user who should have administrative rights and the number of days they should have access. If the number of days is set to 0, the user will have indefinite rights.
